  ## Description:
  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as "Content Management Systems". I build command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

  ## Installation:
  Run the following in the terminal:
  - npm install mysql2        
  - npm install inquirer         
  - npm install console.table --save

  ## Usage:
  Run database, schema, and seed files by running the following commands in mysql shell and Navigate to db/connection.js 	
  - source db/schema.sql
  - source db/seeds.sql
  - input your my sql user and password,
